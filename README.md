# AutoML
An interactive AutoML web application built with Streamlit that simplifies machine learning workflows for both regression and classification tasks. Users can upload datasets, preprocess data (e.g., handle missing values, label encoding, one-hot encoding), select features, train models, and visualize resultsâ€”all without writing code.

Features
Automatic Preprocessing: Missing value handling, label encoding, and one-hot encoding with customizable options.
Task Selection: Supports both regression and classification with various algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM).
Performance Evaluation: Displays metrics such as MSE, R2 Score, Accuracy, F1 Score, and more.
Visualization: Confusion matrix, scatter plots, and prediction probabilities.
Model Export: Download the best-trained model for future use.
